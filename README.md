# IoT Chain and Monitoring Chain

## Project Overview
This project implements a secure, scalable blockchain solution for IoT devices using a lightweight consensus algorithm and Schnorr signatures.it uses consensus algorithm


## Features
- Real-time sensor data logging
- Secure data sharing across IoT applications
- Lightweight consensus for improved performance

## Smart Contracts
- **IoTChain.sol**: Main contract for managing IoT data records.
- **SchnorrSignature.sol**: Library for verifying Schnorr signatures.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Usage
1. Deploy the smart contract using tools like Truffle or Hardhat.
2. Update the `contractAddress` in `IoTChain.js`.
3. Run `node main.js` to monitor IoT device data.
